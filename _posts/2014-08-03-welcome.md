Welcome to the [blog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) by [ontouchstart](http://twitter.com/ontouchstart), hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com) platform with minimum amount of [bells and whistles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_and_whistles).

## About me

Trained as a physicist and a former college professor, I am fascinated by the *mathematical* and *engineering* foundations of *computation* as well as human *consumption* and *development* of computing technology.

## What does "ontouchstart" mean?

"ontouchstart" is an [event handler](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_early.html) for the [touchstart event](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchstart-event). 

Here is an example:

~~~ html
<button ontouchstart="alert('Hello, world!')">
  touche me
</button>
<p>
  This only works on a touch device.
</p>
~~~

[Test it](http://ontouchstart.github.io/sandbox/touchme.html).
