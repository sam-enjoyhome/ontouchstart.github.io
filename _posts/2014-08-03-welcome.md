Welcome to the [blog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) by [ontouchstart](http://twitter.com/ontouchstart), hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com) platform with minimum amount of [bells and whistles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_and_whistles).

## About me

Trained as a physicist and a former college professor, I am fascinated by the *mathematical* and *engineering* foundations of *computation* as well as human *consumption* and *development* of computing technology.

## What does "ontouchstart" mean?

"ontouchstart" is an [event handler](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_early.html) for the [touchstart event](http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchstart-event).

## Why use the name "ontouchstart"?

My experience with computation and computing technology went through four stages during the past two decades:

1. For my physics training and research, computers are tools to collect and analyze data as well as simulate physical and mathematical systems. I use [FORTRAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) and [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) to write [procedural programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) for data processing and explore computational models with *interative systems* such as [Matlab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlab) and [Mathmatica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica). 
2. To present scientific data and idea, I use mathematical typesetting systems such as [TeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) and other visualization tools to create beautiful formulas and charts on paper.
3. I caught the [World Wide Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Www) fever in the late 90s and spent a few years building web sites and [CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) with [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).
4. After several years of college teaching, I went back to computing world facing the new era of mobile, cloud and big data. My entry to this world is modern [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) technology on modern touch based [mobile devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device). The name "ontouchstart" symbolized that transition from machine processes to human interaction. 

This blog is about building computation systems with a human [touch](http://ontouchstart.github.io/sandbox/touchme.html).
